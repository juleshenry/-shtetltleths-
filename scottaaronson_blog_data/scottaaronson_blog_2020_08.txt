Update (Sep 1): Thanks for the comments, everyone!  As you can see, I further revised this blog’s header based on the feedback and on further reflection.The Right could only kill me and everyone I know.The Left is scarier; it could convince me that it was my fault!

(In case you missed it on the blog’s revised header, right below “Quantum computers aren’t just nondeterministic Turing machines” and “Hold the November US election by mail.”  I added an exclamation point at the end to suggest a slightly comic delivery.)

Update: A friend expressed concern that, because my new motto appears to “blame both sides,” it might generate confusion about my sympathies or what I want to happen in November.  So to eliminate all ambiguity: I hereby announce that I will match all reader donations made in the next 72 hours to either the Biden-Harris campaign or the Lincoln Project, up to a limit of $2,000.  Honor system; just tell me in the comments what you donated.
