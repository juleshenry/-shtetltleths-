Consider the following less-than-hypothetical scenarios:

The obvious question in all these cases is: how much extra credence does a person gain by belonging, or having once belonged, to the group he or she is criticizing?  From a strict rationalist standpoint, the answer would seem to be zero: surely all that matters is the soundness of the arguments!  Who cares if the keynote speaker at the anti-widget rally also happens to be past president of the Widget Club?

I can think of three possible reasons for giving extra credence to attacks from insiders:

On the other hand, I can think of five reasons why not to give extra credence to attacks from insiders:

So what’s my verdict?  Belonging to the group you’re criticizing can give you one or two free starting chips at the table of argument, entitling you to a hearing where someone else wouldn’t be so entitled.  But once you’ve sat down and entered the game, from then on you have to play by the same rules as everyone else.

TITLE: Great Ideas In Theoretical Computer Science Lectures 2-7

For those who missed it on the sidebar, we now have six more GITCS lecture notes available:

Lecture 2: Logic

Lecture 3: Circuits and Finite Automata

Lecture 4: Turing Machines

Lecture 5: Reducibility and Gödel

Lecture 6: Minds and Machines

Lecture 7: Complexity

More are on the way — compared to the Democritus notes, it’s so much easier with others doing the writing!  These notes were prepared almost entirely by the students, with only minor editing from me and Yinmeng.  In general, I think the students have been doing a fantastic job.  On the other hand, if you rely on these notes to build a Turing-machine-controlled jumbo jet which then crashes in the Himalayas, it’s entirely possible that it wasn’t my fault.

TITLE: Statement on conceptual contributions in theory
URL: https://scottaaronson.blog/?m=200803
DATE: Friday, March 7th, 2008
CONTENT:
About six months ago, a group of theoretical computer scientists started raising concerns about what they saw as a growing problem in our field.  (My parody post “FOCS’36 notification” was one attempt to explain what this problem is.)  The group has now put together a statement, which I was happy to sign, and which is meant to serve as a starting point for further discussion at the STOC’08 business meeting.  If you support this statement and want add your name to it, please say so in the comments section! Of course criticism is welcome too. –SA

We, the undersigned, are concerned about two related attitudes that seem to be increasingly prevalent in the TCS community, and in particular, are affecting its program committees and their decisions.  The goal of this statement is to attempt to recognize and reverse this trend.  We are happy to note that the STOC’08 PC made a conscious effort to move in the direction of this proposal. The trends that worry us are the following:

Most works offer a mix of conceptual and technical aspects, where by “conceptual” we mean the aspects that can be communicated succinctly, with a minimum amount of technical notation, and yet their content reshapes our view/understanding.  Conceptual contributions can be thought of as contents of the work that are most likely to be a part of a scientific hallway discussion.  They may appear in a work’s “bottom line” or “along the way”.

Needless to say, the above list is not exhaustive.

Once understood, conceptual aspects tend to be viewed as obvious, which actually means that they have become fully incorporated in the worldview of the expert. This positive effect is actually a source of trouble in the evaluation process, because the evaluators forget that these contributions were not obvious at all before being made.

Indeed, our community should be warned of dismissing such contributions by saying “yes, but that’s obvious”; when somebody says such a thing, one should ask “was it obvious to you before reading this article?”

We believe that the community needs to remain vigilant about these issues, and program committees should make a conscious effort to pay attention to conceptual contributions (as apparently done by the STOC’08 PC). This will enable our conferences to continue to be a driving force in the progress of our field.

TITLE: Long-dreaded politics post
URL: https://scottaaronson.blog/?m=200803
DATE: Wednesday, March 5th, 2008
CONTENT:
Until today, I have failed to uphold one of the most sacred responsibilities of the guild of bloggers: that of weighing in on the Democratic primary.  This is not because of any desire to keep politics out of this blog: I’ve never succeeded in keeping anything out of this blog.  Rather, it’s because I find the question genuinely difficult.

The general election is so damn easy by comparison.  There, the only questions I need to ask myself are, “do I prefer the Enlightenment or the Dark Ages that preceded it?  Is the Earth 4.6 billion years old or 10,000?  Do anti-gay laws spring from a less repugnant part of human nature than Jim Crow laws?”  While I look forward to the day when my answers to such questions won’t determine my vote, so far they unfailingly have — thereby eliminating the need for me to adjudicate more complicated social and economic issues that I don’t really understand.

In other words, my view of Democrats and Republicans couldn’t possibly be further from that of (say) Eliezer Yudkowsky, who sees the general US election as a meaningless, Kang vs. Kodos popularity contest. Like Yudkowsky, I can easily imagine two political parties fighting over nothing — but what I see in reality is a clearly-identifiable neo-Union and neo-Confederacy, who every four years re-fight the Civil War.  As many others have pointed out, even the geographic boundary between America’s two subcountries has barely changed since the 1860’s; the one real irony is that the “party of Lincoln” now represents the Confederate side.  (And yes, if the free-market/libertarian wing of the Republican Party ever broke free of the medieval wing, then this correspondence would break down.  I’m only talking about things as they currently stand.)

On the other hand, as Clinton and Obama debated their subtly-different proposals for health insurance, subprime lending reform, etc., I realized that, in a race between Democrats (or a general election in a more normal country), my “go with the Enlightenment” approach can only take me so far.  Faced with two non-lunatic candidates, you almost have to, like, know something about policy or economics to make a sensible choice.

So being an ignorant computer scientist, what can I say?  Let’s start with the obvious: that after seven years of Bush, to ask whether I’d “prefer” Hillary or Obama is like asking a drowning person surrounded by sharks which of two lifeboats he prefers to be rescued by (and adding, in case it’s helpful, that one lifeboat is rowed by a woman and the other by a half-Kenyan).  It’s a shame we can’t elect both of them, and then send one back in time to have been president for the last eight years.  As the next best option, I wish the candidates would just agree right now to choose the winner by an Intrade-weighted coin flip, and thereby save money for defeating the religious-right-courting hypocrite McCain.

But of course they won’t do that, and hence the question of whom to prefer.  Until recently I had a mild preference for Hillary, my reasons being as follows:

Recently, though, I’ve been tilting more toward Obama, for five reasons:

Incidentally, so far as I can tell, the accusations of anti-Semitism against Obama that have filled the right-wing blogosphere are completely baseless. The assumption underlying these accusations is that admiration is a transitive predicate: that is, if x admires y and y admires z (where, say, z=Farrakhan), then x must admire z, even if x claims to “reject and denounce” z.  But it’s easy to think of counterexamples: I admire Sakharov who admired Stalin (at least for part of his life), I admire Bertrand Russell who admired all sorts of thugs and poseurs, etc.  Of course it’s impossible to know Obama’s heart about these matters, but I don’t think one needs to: it’s enough to know his brain.
